This file is for the structure and documentation of the code additions. 



You must get all required functionality from Project 1 working, even if the team you inherited it
from did not --- our project worked upon recieving it, so there was no work needed accieving the previous functionality. 

Implementation of the AI
    We were tasked with adding an AI component to the game, with three different difficulty levels. 
    Easy: It just fires randomly every turn, Medium: It fires randomly until it hits a ship then fires in orthogonally adjacent spaces to find other hits until a ship is sunk.
    Hard: Cheater, cheater pumpkin eater! This mode knows where all your ships are and lands a hit every turn.
    and that all the ai would begin with random ship placement 
    for the implementation we used multiple classes for the AI, Easy AI, Medium AI, Hard AI, with different attack patterns based on how they are meant to preform.  

Custom Addition
    This is a new addition to the classic game of battleship. 
    We decided to add personalities to the 3 AIs we were required to add, so they respond to you after every turn. 
    the easiest AI speaks to you like a child, meduim AI speaks like an older more competent child. 
    While the hardest AI speak to you like a gamer teenager, who uses too many pop culture refrences. 
    All of the dialogue options are kept in 'dialogue.py', and the voices for the Ai are in 'voice.py'.
